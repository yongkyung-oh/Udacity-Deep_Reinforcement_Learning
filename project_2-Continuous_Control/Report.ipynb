    "#### Learning Algorithm \n",
    "Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient or commonly known as DDPG is basically an off-policy method that learns a Q-function and a policy to iterate over actions. It employs the use of off-policy data and the Bellman equation to learn the Q function which is in turn used to derive and learn the policy. (Referred from [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/demystifying-deep-deterministic-policy-gradient-ddpg-uding-chainerrl-and-openai-baselines-a087a11630cc#:~:text=Deep%20Deterministic%20Policy%20Gradient%20or,derive%20and%20learn%20the%20policy.)) \n",
    "\n",
    "DDPG (Lillicrap, et al., 2015), short for Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, is a model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm, combining DPG with DQN. Recall that DQN (Deep Q-Network) stabilizes the learning of Q-function by experience replay and the frozen target network. The original DQN works in discrete space, and DDPG extends it to continuous space with the actor-critic framework while learning a deterministic policy. (Referred from [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html)) \n",
    "\n",
    "DDPG also employs Actor-Critic model in which the Critic model learns the value function like DQN and uses it to determine how the Actor’s policy based model should change. The Actor brings the advantage of learning in continuous actions space without the need for extra layer of optimization procedures required in a value based function while the Critic supplies the Actor with knowledge of the performance.

    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm s an actor-critici method. Policy-based methods using Monte Carlo estimates have high variance problems. TD estimates used in value-based methods have low bias and low variance. Actor critic methods combine these two ideas, the neural network in which the actor renews his or her policies and another neural network in evaluating the policies used to train the actor.\n",

    "The actor network consists of three fully connected layers with batch normalization applied to the first layer. The network map specifies the behavior. Use the ReLU as an activation function except the last layer with a tanh.\n",

    "The Critic Network also consists of three fully connected layers with batch normalization applied to the first layer. Map a network map (state, action) pair to the Q-value. The ReLU is used as an activation feature for the first two layers, and there is no activation function for the last layer.\n",

    "- General optimization techniques such as periodic learning speed and warm restart may also be useful."
